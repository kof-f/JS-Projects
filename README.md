# JS Projects

## Why?
These projects were built to test my knowledge of JavaScript.
They are implemented on my website [here](www.akizzlebrand.com/projects).

## Status
### Done:
* [Digital Clock](www.akizzlebrand.com/digital-clock)
* [Countdown Clock](www.akizzlebrand.com/countdown-clock)
* [Tip Calculator](www.akizzlebrand.com/tip-calculator)

### In Progress:
* [GPA Calculator](www.akizzlebrand.com/gpa-calculator)
    - The logic behind the calculator works. I am currently
implementing the functionality to add classes to the form
that will be tracked and add to the overall GPA calculation
once the submit button is pressed.

### Future Work (using Node.js):
* Notes app
* Task app
* Weather app
* Chat app
